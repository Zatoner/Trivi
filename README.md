# What is it?

Trivi is an Android launcher app designed to replace the default home app, Trivi is minimalistic by nature to avoid distraction and reduce "friction". Trivi also
uses the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs) to provide helpful summaries to the user and recommendations to help them get information faster 
and spend less time on their screen. This is still in its early stages so the feature set is quite basic, but ultimately since Trivi's goal is to stay minimal 
the feature set won't expand that much. Gemini can also be quite unreliable at times due to a rather simplistic implementation for the time being, plans are definitely to
improve its accuracy.


The following sub-sections will showcase Trivi's current core features:
